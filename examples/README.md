# Parser examples

This folder contains examples that were used to test the correctness of parsers on real full files. They are minimal
enough for you to understand how to use this crate as library for your usecase, as well as how these parser modules work
if you wish to contribute to the project.

There is a doc comment at the top of each of the examples that goes into more detail about each file and the parser inside.
